OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.

It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\" response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used.

The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","epss":0.01895,"percentile":0.82736,"date":"2026-01-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"glibc","version":"2.31-13+deb11u3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-4806","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"26e66ebd16b26c96","name":"libc6","version":"2.31-13+deb11u3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:58354abe5f0e9e8cf3849a697cd86bfefb8448b9deb74e3d13aa3e4c98dd3665","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","layerID":"sha256:ad6562704f3759fb50f0d3de5f80a38f65a85e709b77fd24491253990f30b6be","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:ad6562704f3759fb50f0d3de5f80a38f65a85e709b77fd24491253990f30b6be","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:ad6562704f3759fb50f0d3de5f80a38f65a85e709b77fd24491253990f30b6be","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-2","LGPL-2.1"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libc6:libc6:2.31-13\\+deb11u3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libc6@2.31-13%2Bdeb11u3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11&upstream=glibc","upstreams":[{"name":"glibc"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-32205","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-32205","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers in a HTTP response to curl and curl < 7.84.0 stores all of them.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length.  However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large.  An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications.  The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash.    This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO.

And if using the correct file format of course.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-38546","epss":0.00256,"percentile":0.48688,"date":"2026-01-13"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"curl","version":"7.74.0-1.3+deb11u1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-38546","versionConstraint":"< 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u10 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"7.74.0-1.3+deb11u10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"55164cb12fdbcca2","name":"libcurl4","version":"7.74.0-1.3+deb11u1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:58354abe5f0e9e8cf3849a697cd86bfefb8448b9deb74e3d13aa3e4c98dd3665","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libcurl4/copyright","layerID":"sha256:58354abe5f0e9e8cf3849a697cd86bfefb8448b9deb74e3d13aa3e4c98dd3665","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libcurl4/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libcurl4:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:58354abe5f0e9e8cf3849a697cd86bfefb8448b9deb74e3d13aa3e4c98dd3665","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libcurl4:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause","BSD-4-Clause","ISC","curl","other","public-domain"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libcurl4:libcurl4:7.74.0-1.3\\+deb11u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libcurl4@7.74.0-1.3%2Bdeb11u1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11&upstream=curl","upstreams":[{"name":"curl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-3970","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-3970","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"A vulnerability was found in LibTIFF.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring the timing would require either local access to the signing application or a very fast network connection with low latency.  There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular the NIST P-521 curve is affected.

This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-64720","epss":0.00074,"percentile":0.22641,"date":"2026-01-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-64720","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"libpng1.6","version":"1.6.37-3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-64720","versionConstraint":"< 1.6.37-3+deb11u1 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.6.37-3+deb11u1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"b74732b8fd8b87cf","name":"libpng16-16","version":"1.6.37-3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:58354abe5f0e9e8cf3849a697cd86bfefb8448b9deb74e3d13aa3e4c98dd3665","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libpng16-16/copyright","layerID":"sha256:58354abe5f0e9e8cf3849a697cd86bfefb8448b9deb74e3d13aa3e4c98dd3665","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libpng16-16/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libpng16-16:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:58354abe5f0e9e8cf3849a697cd86bfefb8448b9deb74e3d13aa3e4c98dd3665","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libpng16-16:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0","BSD-3-clause","BSD-like-with-advertising-clause","GPL-2","GPL-2+","expat","libpng"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libpng16-16:libpng16-16:1.6.37-3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16-16:libpng16_16:1.6.37-3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16_16:libpng16-16:1.6.37-3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16_16:libpng16_16:1.6.37-3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16:libpng16-16:1.6.37-3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16:libpng16_16:1.6.37-3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpng16-16@1.6.37-3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11&upstream=libpng1.6","upstreams":[{"name":"libpng1.6"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-22946","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22946","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"A user can tell curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 to require a successful upgrade to TLS when speaking to an IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (`--ssl-reqd` on the command line or`CURLOPT_USE_SSL` set to `CURLUSESSL_CONTROL` or `CURLUSESSL_ALL` withlibcurl).

This could lead to libcurl using the wrong credentials when performing a transfer, potentially allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-27535","epss":0.00074,"percentile":0.22597,"date":"2026-01-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-27535","cwe":"CWE-305","source":"support@hackerone.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-27535","cwe":"CWE-287","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"curl","version":"7.74.0-1.3+deb11u1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-27535","versionConstraint":"< 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u8 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"7.74.0-1.3+deb11u8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"55164cb12fdbcca2","name":"libcurl4","version":"7.74.0-1.3+deb11u1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:58354abe5f0e9e8cf3849a697cd86bfefb8448b9deb74e3d13aa3e4c98dd3665","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libcurl4/copyright","layerID":"sha256:58354abe5f0e9e8cf3849a697cd86bfefb8448b9deb74e3d13aa3e4c98dd3665","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libcurl4/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libcurl4:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:58354abe5f0e9e8cf3849a697cd86bfefb8448b9deb74e3d13aa3e4c98dd3665","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libcurl4:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause","BSD-4-Clause","ISC","curl","other","public-domain"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libcurl4:libcurl4:7.74.0-1.3\\+deb11u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libcurl4@7.74.0-1.3%2Bdeb11u1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11&upstream=curl","upstreams":[{"name":"curl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-22898","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22898","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"curl 7.7 through 7.76.1 suffers from an information disclosure when the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers.

Impact summary: This out-of-bounds read may trigger a crash which leads to Denial of Service for an application. The out-of-bounds write can cause a memory corruption which can have various consequences including a Denial of Service or Execution of attacker-supplied code.

This issue has been patched in version 1.6.51.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-64505","epss":0.00019,"percentile":0.04303,"date":"2026-01-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-64505","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"libpng1.6","version":"1.6.37-3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-64505","versionConstraint":"< 1.6.37-3+deb11u1 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.6.37-3+deb11u1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"b74732b8fd8b87cf","name":"libpng16-16","version":"1.6.37-3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:58354abe5f0e9e8cf3849a697cd86bfefb8448b9deb74e3d13aa3e4c98dd3665","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libpng16-16/copyright","layerID":"sha256:58354abe5f0e9e8cf3849a697cd86bfefb8448b9deb74e3d13aa3e4c98dd3665","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libpng16-16/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libpng16-16:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:58354abe5f0e9e8cf3849a697cd86bfefb8448b9deb74e3d13aa3e4c98dd3665","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libpng16-16:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0","BSD-3-clause","BSD-like-with-advertising-clause","GPL-2","GPL-2+","expat","libpng"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libpng16-16:libpng16-16:1.6.37-3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16-16:libpng16_16:1.6.37-3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16_16:libpng16-16:1.6.37-3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16_16:libpng16_16:1.6.37-3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16:libpng16-16:1.6.37-3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libpng16:libpng16_16:1.6.37-3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libpng16-16@1.6.37-3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11&upstream=libpng1.6","upstreams":[{"name":"libpng1.6"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-64506","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-64506","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"LIBPNG is a reference library for use in applications that read, create, and manipulate PNG (Portable Network Graphics) raster image files.
