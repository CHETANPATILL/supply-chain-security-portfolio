Maven will follow repositories that are defined in a dependency’s Project Object Model (pom) which may be surprising to some users, resulting in potential risk if a malicious actor takes over that repository or is able to insert themselves into a position to pretend to be that repository. Maven is changing the default behavior in 3.8.1+ to no longer follow http (non-SSL) repository references by default. More details available in the referenced urls. If you are currently using a repository manager to govern the repositories used by your builds, you are unaffected by the risks present in the legacy behavior, and are unaffected by this vulnerability and change to default behavior.

Prior to version 4.8.0, using AbstractUnArchiver for extracting an archive might lead to an arbitrary file creation and possibly remote code execution. When extracting an archive with an entry that already exists in the destination directory as a symbolic link whose target does not exist - the `resolveFile()` function will return the symlink's source instead of its target, which will pass the verification that ensures the file will not be extracted outside of the destination directory. Later `Files.newOutputStream()`, that follows symlinks by default,  will actually write the entry's content to the symlink's target. Whoever uses plexus archiver to extract an untrusted archive is vulnerable to an arbitrary file creation and possibly remote code execution.

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each \"tar xf\" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run \"tar xf\" more than once into the same directory.","cvss":[{"source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","epss":0.00048,"percentile":0.14797,"date":"2026-01-23"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","cwe":"CWE-24","source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"24.04"},"package":{"name":"tar","version":"1.35+dfsg-3build1"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-45582","versionConstraint":"none

A cookie is set using the `secure` keyword for `https://target` \n 2. curl is redirected to or otherwise made to speak with `http://target` (same \n   hostname, but using clear text HTTP) using the same cookie set \n 3. The same cookie name is set - but with just a slash as path (`path=\\\"/\\\",`).\n   Since this site is not secure, the cookie *should* just be ignored.\n4. A bug in the path comparison logic makes curl read outside a heap buffer\n   boundary\n\nThe bug either causes a crash or it potentially makes the comparison come to\nthe wrong conclusion and lets the clear-text site override the contents of the\nsecure cookie, contrary to expectations and depending on the memory contents\nimmediately following the single-byte allocation that holds the path.\n\nThe presumed and correct behavior would be to plainly ignore the second set of\nthe cookie since it was already set as secure on a secure host so overriding\nit on an insecure host should not be okay.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-9086","epss":0.00037,"percentile":0.10982,"date":"2026-01-23"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-9086","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"24.04"},"package":{"name":"curl","version":"8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-9086","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"83f0f2255ea803f0","name":"libcurl4t64","version":"8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:f2c5be9e24f3d5f274d4d149bcfdff6b807970048b69e735635708d786aa2687","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libcurl4t64/copyright","layerID":"sha256:f2c5be9e24f3d5f274d4d149bcfdff6b807970048b69e735635708d786aa2687","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libcurl4t64/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libcurl4t64:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:f2c5be9e24f3d5f274d4d149bcfdff6b807970048b69e735635708d786aa2687","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libcurl4t64:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause","BSD-3-clause","BSD-4-Clause-UC","FSFULLR","GPL-2","GPL-2+","GPL-3+","ISC","OLDAP-2.8","X11","curl"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libcurl4t64:libcurl4t64:8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libcurl4t64@8.5.0-2ubuntu10.6?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-24.04&upstream=curl","upstreams":[{"name":"curl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-14819","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-14819","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:24.04","severity":"Low","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-14819","epss":0.00036,"percentile":0.10422,"date":"2026-01-23"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-14819","cwe":"CWE-295","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0108},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-14819","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-14819","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2025-14819.html","https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2025-14819.json","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2026/01/07/5"],"description":"When doing TLS related transfers with reused easy or multi handles and\naltering the  `CURLSSLOPT_NO_PARTIALCHAIN` option, libcurl could accidentally\nreuse a CA store cached in memory for which the partial chain option was\nreversed.
