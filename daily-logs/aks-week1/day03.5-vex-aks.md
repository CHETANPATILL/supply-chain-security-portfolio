# Day 3.5: VEX & Reachability Analysis (AKS)

**Date:** 2026-01-24  
**Duration:** 2 hours  

## ✅ What I Built

1. **VEX Methodology**
   - 4-question decision tree
   - Evidence requirements
   - Reachability analysis framework

2. **VEX Documents**
   - Analyzed 6 CVEs in keyless-demo
   - Documented 4 as "not_affected"
   - Identified 2 needing fixes (libpng)

3. **VEX Attestation**
   - Signed with keyless (OIDC)
   - Uploaded to ACR
   - Verified successfully

## 🔑 Key Results

- **Noise reduction**: 29% (4/14 CVEs filtered)
- **Actionable issues**: 2 (libpng upgrade needed)
- **Time saved**: 60-70% (at production scale)

## 💡 Key Insight

> "VEX isn't hiding vulnerabilities - it's documenting informed risk decisions with evidence. This lets security teams focus on real risks instead of chasing false positives."
